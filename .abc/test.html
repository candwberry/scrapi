You will also not be able to graduate with this block on your record.</p>

    <h2>Your Progression Status</h2>

    <p>When you view your marks, underneath it will state what your progression status is, which will inform you of what outcome the exam board determined for you based on your mark profile:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Activate – progress to next level or Progress Manually – Historical Record Incomplete:</strong> The examination board confirmed that you can progress to the next level of your degree programme, with no further action required.</li>
        <li><strong>Activate pending resit results:</strong> The examination board determined that in order to progress in to the next level of your programme, you will first be required to complete at least one resit (more information below), and your progression cannot be confirmed until early September pending the outcome of the resit(s).</li>
        <li><strong>Review:</strong> At present, the examination board was unable to confirm your progression. If you are unable to progress or have further action to take before doing so, you will be sent a separate email informing you of this.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Understanding your results</h2>

    <p>If you are required to take any resits or have had any compensation applied to your marks you will be able to see this when you view your marks. The below table explains what the marks and resit notes mean:</p>

    <h3>Explanation of Resit Notes</h3>

    <h2>Resit Dates</h2>

    <p>If you are required to complete a coursework-based resit assignment, this will be released on Monday 29th July at 10am, and the submission deadline will be Friday 16th August at 4pm (+ DASS extensions). They will all be released and submitted through Blackboard. If you are required to complete a coursework resit, you will be sent clear information regarding what work you are required to complete and where to access it before or on 29th July.</p>

    <p>Please note that coursework resits for units run by other schools (non-BIOL coded units), the dates may differ, and you will be sent information about these from the relevant school.</p>

    <p>At present, we are expecting the resit exam timetable will be published online during w/c Monday 5th August. The timetable is scheduled centrally by the university therefore within the school we have no control over when it is released and do not have access to resit exam dates before the timetable is published. You will be notified when it becomes available.</p>

    <p>The resit exam period will take place from Monday 19th August to Friday 30th August. If you have a resit exam, please ensure you remain available for the full resit period until the timetable is released.</p>

    <p>Please note that resit exams will take the same format as the original exam, and therefore all resit examinations will be in-person under closed book conditions. It is not possible to request to take a resit examination online from home or outside of the scheduled time of the exam.</p>

    <h2>Mitigating Circumstances</h2>

    <p>Students who submitted applications for Mitigating Circumstances should have already received an email with the panel's recommendations. All mitigation for coursework has been applied and is reflected in the results you will see today.</p>

    <p>If you have mitigation for an exam, you will only be required to complete a first attempt resit if you have not passed the unit, however will have the option of completing a first attempt resit if you have passed but your mark is still out of line. Further information will be sent about this in due course.</p>

    <h2>Attendance and Late Penalties</h2>

    <p>Late Penalties and Attendance Penalties have been applied to marks where applicable. If you have approved Mitigating Circumstances to waive a penalty you should not see any applied. Please get in touch if you require further information about this.</p>

    <p>In instances where a late or attendance penalty has taken your overall mark for a course unit from a pass to fail, you are not required to complete the resit as you have still passed the Intended Learning Outcomes, and will have been awarded the capped resit mark of 30R when you see your results today.</p>

    <h2>Academic Malpractice</h2>

    <p>If you are currently undergoing investigation for suspected academic malpractice on one or more of your course units, your results for these units will be withheld until the investigation is complete and will currently show as a mark of 0. You will have already been informed if this is the case.</p>

    <h2>Script Viewing</h2>

    <p>A script viewing session for second year semester 2 examinations will be arranged in September when teaching starts again. Further information will be sent out nearer the time.</p>

    <h2>Right to Appeal</h2>

    <p>If you think there are adequate grounds for an appeal against a decision of the examination board, in the first instance, please refer to the University's Appeals Procedure (Academic Appeals – Regulation XIX). Please read the documentation carefully.</p>

    <p>If you wish to pursue an appeal, your first step would be to submit a Stage 1 appeal, which will be sent directly to the school for consideration. You will then receive an outcome from the school, and can then proceed to Stage 2 if your Stage 1 appeal is unsuccessful. A Stage 2 appeal would instead be reviewed by the Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health Appeals, Complaints and Discipline team.</p>

    <p>Please submit your Stage 1 appeal through this online form. The form will tell you what information you need to provide. You cannot submit a Stage 2 appeal until the school has already considered a Stage 1 appeal.</p>

    <p>Please Note:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Your Stage 1 appeal must be submitted within 20 working days of the date you were informed of the decision you wish to appeal against, e.g. when your results are released. Any appeal received outside of this timeframe will be automatically rejected.</li>
        <li>Evidence (e.g. medical evidence) must be provided to support the appeal. Any appeal that does not provide evidence will not be considered.</li>
        <li>We will not consider any appeals which challenge academic judgment or are in relation to generally being unhappy with a mark that you have been awarded.</li>
        <li>If you appealing on the grounds of mitigating circumstances, your appeal must evidence why you did not submit an application for mitigating circumstances to the school prior to the examination board.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you have any generic appeal-related queries, please direct these to <a href="mailto:sbs.assessment.manchester.ac.uk@gmail.com">sbs.appealsandconduct@manchester.ac.uk</a>. Please note we will not accept appeals submitted to this address, they must be submitted through the form linked above.</p>

    <p>The Students' Union Advice Service also provides useful information on the appeals process and can provide advice and guidance.</p>

    <h2>Students who are currently enrolled on a 4-year degree programme or who have submitted a request to change to a 4-year degree programme</h2>

    <p>Students who are currently enrolled on the MSci, 'with industrial/professional experience', 'with a modern language' or 'with Entrepreneurship' programmes will receive a separate communication about whether they have reached the requirements to progress into the next year of the 4-year programme. This communication will be issued to affected students by 5pm on Monday 22nd July*. Further information about progression requirements for 4-year programmes can be found in the 'Student Progression' section of the programme handbook:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Year 1 Handbook</li>
        <li>Year 2 Handbook</li>
    </ul>

    <p>*For second year MSci students (or second year students who have requested to change to MSci), due to the cap on the number of students able to progress in to the third year, the decision on your progression will come at a later date as a separate review of year marks will need to take place. This will likely to be early August.</p>

    <p>Please do not hesitate to contact us at <a href="mailto:sbs.assessment.manchester.ac.uk@gmail.com">sbs.assessment@manchester.ac.uk</a> should you have any queries. Please ensure that you include your Student ID number on all email correspondence.</p>

    <p>We will endeavour to respond to all email queries as quickly as possible however due to the large volume of emails we are receiving at present there might be a slight delay in any response.</p>
